# Roadmap

**Last updated:** 2026-06-21 (offline banner + retry-visibility toasts)

## How we work

Work is organised into **phases** — each phase has a clear deliverable and a smoke test. Phases 1–4 are complete; remaining incomplete items are explicit backend-blocked or phase-sequenced deferrals, not hidden Phase 4 work.

**Phases 5–8 were re-planned on 2026-06-21**, replacing the original 5a–5e/6/7/8 split. The original split was organized by *what the backend would unblock next* (it assumed most pages stayed blocked until rhizome#120's P1 tier landed). Re-checking every cited blocker found that picture was stale — #112–#130 and the relevant #132 follow-up issues (#133/#134/#137) are now closed. With nearly everything unblocked, the new split is organized by *what makes the product usable soonest*: agent chat first (it exercises the full stack top to bottom and is the product's differentiator), then the daily-operations pages, then garden/plant management, then polish. See each phase below for current per-feature blocker status — don't trust old "blocked on #120" citations anywhere else in this repo's docs without rechecking.

This file is the single source of truth for phase planning and status — what to build, in what order, and what's actually done versus still planned. There's no separate per-phase history doc; as a phase completes, this file's entry for it is updated in place to describe what actually shipped (including any bugs found and fixed along the way), rather than just what was originally planned.

---

## Phase 0 — Pre-build setup ✅

Before writing any application code.

- CLAUDE.md written to repo root
- Confirmed Cambium runs on `:8080`
- Confirmed Rhizome runs on `:8001`
- Confirmed test user exists (`POST /auth/register` once)

**Done when:** `curl http://localhost:8080/health` returns `{"status":"ok"}`

---

## Phase 1 — Scaffold + build tooling ✅

**Deliverable:** Project boots, proxies to Cambium, TypeScript compiles clean.

Done:
- Vite 8, React 19, TypeScript strict mode
- Vite proxy: `/api` + `/auth` → `localhost:8080`
- `@/` path alias
- `react-router-dom`, `@tanstack/react-query`, `@tanstack/react-table` installed
- Prettier, ESLint
- `.env.example`, `.nvmrc` (Node 24)
- Empty `src/styles/`, `src/lib/`, `src/components/`, `src/pages/`, `src/routes/`
- `App.tsx` renders `<div>Verdant Pages</div>`
- **Vitest + @testing-library/react** — unit/component test scaffold
- **Playwright** — E2E scaffold with Chromium

**Smoke test:** `npm run dev` starts without errors; `curl http://localhost:8080/health` returns `{"status":"ok"}` against Cambium; `npm run build` produces a clean dist; App renders.

---

## Phase 2 — Tokens + theme + fonts ✅

**Deliverable:** Full visual foundation — light/dark toggle works, all four fonts load.

- `src/styles/tokens.css` — full token system, port verbatim from the prototype study (now [`design/mockups/base/typography-and-surfaces.html`](../design/mockups/base/typography-and-surfaces.html)): inkwell/vellum scale, RGB channel variables, border radius scale, display variation tokens, semantic surface/text/line tokens for both themes
- `src/styles/global.css` — reset, body, scrollbar, shared keyframes (`pIn`, `vsA`, `acceptGlow`)
- `src/styles/utilities.css` — layout and chip utilities (`.dg`, `.gg`, `.chip`, `.hr`, `.cd`, `.nb`)
- Google Fonts `<link>` in `index.html` — Shantell Sans, Caveat, Nunito, Montserrat
- `ThemeProvider` — reads/writes `localStorage('theme')`, sets `data-theme` on `<html>`, defaults to dark
- `App.tsx` wrapped in `ThemeProvider`

**Smoke test:** Toggle switches between dark (`#181510`) and light (`#FAF6EE`) backgrounds; Shantell Sans, Caveat, Nunito, Montserrat all render visibly different.

**Tests:** 9 unit (ThemeProvider) + 3 E2E (default dark, toggle to light, persistence on reload) — folded into the broader suite in Phase 3.

---

## Phase 3 — Primitives + app shell ✅

**Deliverable:** Full app shell with navigation, all 7 nav items, collapse behavior, theme toggle, all routes stubbed.

**Primitives:** `Button` (primary/ghost/danger, sm/md), `Input`, `Select`, `Textarea`, `Chip` (with optional remove), `FieldLabel`, `Modal` (focus-trapped, Escape closes), `InlinePopover`, `StatusBadge`, `ProgressBar`

**Shell:** `AppShell` (renamed from `VPNav` for genericness), `AppNav` — all 7 nav items with icons, badge slots, collapse to 52px, pending-state color dim; `QuickActionsPanel`, `GardenProfileCard`, `NavFooter` (avatar placeholder, theme toggle, notification bell), `NotificationDrawer`/`Toast` empty shells (wired in Phase 8), `Breadcrumb`

**Router:** all routes from [routes.md](../architecture/routes.md), 27 page stubs, `ProtectedRoute` (passthrough until Phase 4)

**Smoke test:** All 7 nav items render with correct icons/labels and clicking each changes active state and renders the stub; collapse to 52px shows only icons with pending-state color dim; nav badge slots render; `GardenProfileCard`/`QuickActionsPanel` visible and positioned correctly.

**Tests:** 30 total (20 unit + 10 E2E) covering all 7 nav items, collapse/expand + persistence, pending-badge "lit icon" state, route navigation, notification drawer, theme toggle, Toast and Breadcrumb component behavior.

---

## Phase 4 — Auth + API client foundation ✅ complete (`birch`)

**Deliverable:** Login and register work against the real Cambium API. Protected routes redirect correctly. Proactive token refresh runs. All API modules are written and typed.

**Done so far — auth core, verified end-to-end against a real Cambium instance:**
- `LandingPage` — public marketing page at `/` (wordmark, tagline, GitHub link, theme toggle, Login/Sign Up)
- `src/lib/api/client.ts` — `apiFetch`, `ApiError`, in-memory token store, 401→refresh→retry. A 401 only triggers refresh when a token was actually attached, so a bad-login 401 surfaces as a normal `ApiError` instead of looping into the refresh/redirect path. Concurrent 401s share one in-flight refresh instead of racing two — refresh tokens rotate on every use, so two simultaneous refreshes would otherwise race and the loser would fail, forcing a spurious logout on an otherwise-healthy session.
- `src/lib/api/auth.ts` — `login`, `register`, `logout`, `tryRefreshToken`, `getSession`
- `src/lib/auth/context.tsx` — `AuthProvider`, `useAuth`; silent refresh on mount, `setInterval` proactive refresh every 12 minutes, `visibilitychange` refresh-if-stale
- `ProtectedRoute` / `PublicOnlyRoute` — real check, redirects to `/login` when unauthenticated (or to `/app/today` when already authenticated and hitting `/login`/`/register`), shows a loading state while resolving
- `AuthLayout`, `LoginPage`, `RegisterPage` — real forms wired to `useAuth().login`/`.register`, inline error messages for 401 (bad credentials) / 409 (email taken) / generic failure. Registration is intentionally public — obscurity is the gate for now; revisit if the project becomes more public.
- A "Log out" button landed in `AppNav`'s footer
- `QueryClientProvider` wired into `App.tsx`
- Vite proxy confirmed working end-to-end against real Cambium (manual `curl` + full Playwright suite)
- `ThemeToggle` extracted into a shared primitive, used by `AppNav`, `LandingPage`, and `AuthLayout`
- Password strength meter on `RegisterPage` — 4-bar indicator enforcing length, letters+numbers, uppercase, special-character requirements
- Fixed a real StrictMode bug in `context.tsx`: the mount effect was double-invoked in dev, firing `/auth/refresh` twice and racing one cookie rotation against the other's revoke. Fixed with a `hasMountedRef` guard; regression test added under `<StrictMode>`.
- Tests: full suite now 229 unit + 19 E2E, all passing against a live Cambium instance. `auth.spec.ts` covers register→logout→login, direct login, wrong-password rejection, registering an already-taken email, and the unauthenticated-redirect case.

**Domain modules — 15/16 built:** `garden.ts`, `plants.ts`, `tasks.ts`, `calendar.ts`, `shopping.ts`, `search.ts`, `alerts.ts`, `notifications.ts`, `interactions.ts`, `chat.ts`, `triage.ts`, `weather.ts`, `incidents.ts`, `projects.ts`, `activity.ts`, plus `src/lib/types/rhizome.ts`. Built only against endpoints confirmed to return real structured JSON. `triage.ts`/`weather.ts` landed after independently verifying rhizome#133, `projects.ts`/`activity.ts` landed after rhizome#134/#137 were verified and closed, and the final structured cleanup (`listTasksBlocked`, `batchRemovePlants`, intentionally absent `getTriageRecommendations`) is complete.

**`src/lib/sse/stream.ts` is also built** (`consumeSSEStream`, `consumeNotificationStream`), unblocking `chat.ts`'s `streamChat`/`streamResume` and `notifications.ts`'s `streamNotifications`. Both accept an optional `AbortSignal` for client-side cancellation (logout, route change, unmount) — added after a coverage audit found there was previously no way to cancel an open stream.

**Live-verified against the real stack:** ran the actual SSE wire-parsing logic against running Cambium → Rhizome with two providers (default `google_genai`, explicit `openai`). That pass found rhizome#141, a real backend bug in the streaming path; the backend fix was later verified and the issue was closed. The same pass found and fixed two frontend bugs: `stream.ts` sent the literal header `Bearer null` when logged out instead of omitting it, and there was no way to cancel an open stream at all.

229 total tests (101 new this pass).

**rhizome#140 closed — garden/plants/tasks CRUD writes + remaining activity feeds, verified before closing (code review, 50 new rhizome tests, full 798-test suite, live curl checks against a running instance — including a real route-ordering bug found and fixed: `PATCH /garden/plants/batch` was unreachable because it was registered after `{plant_id}`).** Unblocked almost everything that was previously omitted from `garden.ts`/`plants.ts`/`tasks.ts`: `updateGardenProfile`, `updateBed`, `createContainer`, `updateContainer`, `getBedActivity`, `getContainerActivity`, `getPlant`, `createPlant`, `updatePlant`, `createPlantBatch`, `batchUpdatePlants`, `getPlantActivity`, `getBatchActivity`, `updateTask`, `getTaskActivity`, `updateTaskSeries` — all now built, typed, tested, and live-verified against a running instance. New types: `ActivityEventView`, `ActivitySubjectView`, `PlantBatchResultView`; corrected a few existing request types (`CreateContainerRequest`, `CreatePlantRequest`, `UpdateTaskRequest`, `UpdateTaskSeriesRequest`) against the actual rhizome tool signatures.

245 total tests (16 new this pass).

**Coverage audit (2026-06-21):** cross-referenced every exported function in all 16 domain modules against its test file — full coverage confirmed, no gaps. Found and closed two real component-level gaps that had nothing to do with the recent backend work:
- `NotificationDrawer` had a `useEffect`-registered Escape-key listener with zero test coverage (the classic stale-closure/missed-cleanup bug shape) — E2E only covered open + close-via-button. New `NotificationDrawer.test.tsx` (8 tests) covers Escape, backdrop-click, click-inside-doesn't-close, and listener cleanup on unmount.
- `PasswordStrengthMeter`'s own rendering (bar count, color level, Weak/Fair/Good/Strong label, per-requirement met/unmet) was only indirectly exercised once through `RegisterPage.test.tsx`'s single "Strong" assertion — the scoring logic itself (`passwordStrength.ts`) was well-tested, but the component's render branches weren't. New `PasswordStrengthMeter.test.tsx` (6 tests) covers all four strength levels plus per-requirement met/unmet state.

259 total tests (14 new this pass).

**Offline banner + retry-visibility toasts (2026-06-21):** built the connectivity/toast plumbing that `error-handling.md` had specified since before Phase 4 started but never had anything to attach to. `src/lib/toast/toastStore.ts` (generic module-level toast store), `src/lib/connectivity/connectivity.ts` (offline detection: native `online`/`offline` events + a three-consecutive-failure fallback), `OfflineBanner` in `AppShell`, and `src/lib/query/queryClient.ts` (custom `retry`: skips `ApiError` entirely, retries a raw network failure up to 3x with a toast per attempt) — this also fills in `lib/query/`, previously empty. Also corrected a stale claim in `error-handling.md`: the notification stream's auto-reconnect-with-backoff was documented as built but `stream.ts` never had any reconnect logic — re-spec'd as not-yet-built and scheduled with notification UI wiring in Phase 8.

285 total tests (26 new this pass).

**`incidents.ts` built (2026-06-21), unblocked by rhizome#135's closure.** Full incident CRUD (`listIncidents`, `getIncident`, `createIncident`, `updateIncident`, `deleteIncident`, `resolveIncident`) plus treatment-plan management (`getIncidentTreatment`, `createManualTreatmentPlan`, `updateTreatmentPlan`, `deleteTreatmentPlan`, `approveTreatmentPlan`), `getIncidentActivity`, and the AI-trigger `draftTreatmentPlan(id, threadId)` (Cambium's `triggerTreatmentDraft`, same pattern as `triage.ts`'s `runTriage`). New types in `rhizome.ts`. 15 new tests.

300 total tests at this checkpoint (15 new this pass).

**`projects.ts` and `activity.ts` built (2026-06-21), unblocked by rhizome#134/#137.** Projects covers project CRUD, progress, briefs, proposals, project tasks/task graph, task generation trigger, series, bed/container/plant assignment envelopes, activity, expenses, expense summary, and shopping. Activity covers the global activity feed and stats. 17 focused API tests added.

**Structured cleanup complete:** `listTasksBlocked` is built against structured `GET /tasks/blocked`, and `batchRemovePlants` is built against structured `PATCH /garden/plants/batch/remove`. There is intentionally no `getTriageRecommendations` because `getLatestTriage()` is the supported structured path.

**Completion verification (2026-06-21):** `npm run lint`, `npm run test:run` (323 Vitest tests), `npm run build`, and `npm run test:e2e` (20 Playwright tests) all pass on Node 24. The final test audit added direct `refreshAccessToken` coverage for success, rejected refresh, and concurrent refresh de-duplication.

**Intentionally deferred:** `media.ts` — genuinely not started in Rhizome at all (rhizome#117), separate from the structured-JSON backlog.

See [deferred-work.md](../development/deferred-work.md) for the full breakdown of what's deferred and why.

## Phase 5 — Chat and context

**Deliverable:** Agent chat fully functional end to end (streaming, interaction approval, context-aware entry from other pages), Today page live with real briefing data, Incidents fully CRUD-able with the treatment plan flow, and the global Activity feed with filtering. This phase deliberately exercises the full stack — auth, SSE, multi-page context-passing — before building out the rest of the app, and gives a way to both *direct* Rhizome (chat) and *verify* what it did (Activity).

**No real blockers left for core 5b chat.** #136 (interactions), #126/#127 (search + pinned context), #135 (incidents), #141 (SSE streaming), #142 (duplicate/internal chat-stream tokens), #134 (global activity), rhizome#146 (structured thread session context), and the Cambium session-context proxy work are all implemented.

### Agent chat (Rhizome)

`SessionStrip`, thread home + scrollable thread list, sticky thread header, model selector display, split message/pinned context controls (unified + typed search, #126/#127 closed), `ChatThread` (`StreamingMessage`, `MessageBubble`, day separators), anchored `Composer`, light thread/review drawers, `InteractionPanel` (`PendingInteractionList` + `InteractionCard`), context-aware entry (URL params → pre-fill + new/existing thread choice). **Page:** `RhizomePage`

`/app/rhizome` is the thread home. It does not silently auto-create a thread. With no threads, show a blank new-thread composer state; with existing threads, show a scrollable recent-thread list plus a new-thread entrypoint. `Upload Photo` is omitted until media endpoints land. The model selector lives in the topbar; it displays `preferred_provider`/`preferred_model` from session now and becomes editable once cambium#20 lands.

Startup intake is now structured end to end. Verdant has typed client wrappers for `GET/PATCH /api/v1/threads/{id}/session-context`; SessionStrip display/edit flows should use that dedicated `SessionContextView` endpoint, not raw `ThreadView.session_context` metadata.

**Smoke test:** Send a message → tokens stream in real time while the composer remains anchored; receive an interaction event → right drawer opens with review card; accept a proposal → stream resumes, follow-up message appears; "Ask Rhizome about Cherry Tomatoes" from plant detail → opens pre-seeded thread.

### Phase 5 subphases

`maple` is the Phase 5 planning/spec branch. Each implementation subphase below should be a separate branch and PR so Phase 5 stays reviewable. Branch names branch from `maple` and use maple species.

| Subphase | Branch | Tangible output | Smoke test |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5a Activity foundation | `sugar-maple` | `FilterRail`, `ObjectActivityFeed`, `ActivityPage` with real `GET /api/v1/activity` data and lazy infinite scroll | Global feed renders recent events; category filter narrows results; scrolling loads older events via `before_timestamp` |
| 5b Thread home, streaming chat, and first-pass context | `red-maple` | `/app/rhizome` thread home/list, `/app/rhizome/:threadId`, anchored composer, streaming messages, sticky thread header, read-only model display, session/start controls, light thread/review drawers, first-pass interaction panel, resume stream actions, message-context UI, pinned-thread context search/add/remove | No-thread state can start a thread; existing threads are selectable; sending a message streams tokens and ends cleanly with the composer anchored; pending interaction opens review drawer; pinned context updates chips and backend |
| 5c Rich interaction/context entry polish | `silver-maple` | Compact inline interaction summaries, richer typed review cards, pending interaction queue affordances if the API exposes more than one pending item, context-aware entry modal, backend-supported per-message context, inline `plant:`/`task:` object tagging, agent-authored object links that open the right inspection panel | Inline interaction summaries render in chat; context-aware entry from detail pages can create a new contextual thread or add context to the active thread; object references can be discovered from the composer or Rhizome replies |
| 5d Incidents and treatment plans | `japanese-maple` | Incidents list/detail/new route, filters, manual treatment plan editor, Rhizome draft trigger, approve/resolve flows | Create incident; add manual plan; approve plan generates tasks; resolve incident updates status |
| 5e Today page integration | `vine-maple` | Real Today page using weather, latest triage, pending interactions, active projects, top tasks, mini calendar | Today shows real briefing/conditions/tasks; pending interaction is actionable; links navigate to Rhizome/Tasks/Calendar |
| 5f Phase 5 hardening | `bigleaf-maple` | Cross-page polish, loading/error/empty states, E2E coverage for core Phase 5 flows, docs finalization | Full Phase 5 smoke suite passes against live Cambium/Rhizome |

#### 5a implementation slices

1. **API and shape audit:** Confirm `activity.ts`, `ActivityEventView`, supported list params, and existing tests. Fix small API/type drift before UI work.
2. **Static Activity page skeleton:** Replace the placeholder `/app/activity` with the final responsive layout using local sample data: left `FilterRail`, main chronological feed, event rows, and loading/empty/error placeholders.
3. **Real data wiring:** Connect `ActivityPage` to `listActivity()`, including initial load, loading state, error/retry, empty state, and real event rendering.
4. **Filters:** Wire the filter rail to supported activity query params, starting with category, event type, since/before dates, and reset behavior.
5. **Lazy infinite scroll:** Add sentinel-driven pagination using `before_timestamp`, appending results without duplicates while preserving active filters.
6. **Test and polish pass:** Add focused API/page/component coverage for rendering, filters, retry, empty state, and pagination; finish responsive polish and update docs to mark 5a implemented.

**5a status:** Implemented on `sugar-maple`. Activity history intentionally uses lazy infinite scroll instead of numbered pagination; the page consumes Rhizome's `before_timestamp` cursor through a scroll sentinel so users can scan backward through the journal without leaving the current filter context. Coverage includes API query construction, page-level filter/date validation, activity feed states, event row rendering, custom filter controls, infinite-scroll observer behavior, cursor pagination with duplicate suppression, filter reset after pagination, and mocked Playwright E2E for busy feeds, filter queries, invalid date guards, dropdown/calendar close behavior, mobile overflow, and stale-response races. An opt-in live backend activity smoke exists behind `VERDANT_LIVE_ACTIVITY_E2E=1`.

#### 5b implementation slices

1. **Contract and blocker audit:** Align chat/thread types and docs with the closed Rhizome session-context work, add Verdant wrappers for `GET/PATCH /threads/{id}/session-context`, and confirm Cambium proxies the dedicated SessionContextView endpoint.
2. **Workbench shell and thread home:** Replace the placeholder `/app/rhizome` with the thread rail, blank new-thread state, recent-thread list, selected-thread route shell, read-only model display, and honest session-context placeholders.
3. **Message history and composer prep:** Load `/threads/{id}/messages`, render user/Rhizome bubbles with day separators, loading/error/empty states, and keep the composer prepared but not fully streaming yet.
4. **New thread creation and first message flow:** From `/app/rhizome`, submitting the first message creates a thread, navigates to `/app/rhizome/:threadId`, and hands the message to the streaming path. The page must not silently create a thread on load.
5. **Streaming send flow:** Wire `streamChat` with optimistic user bubbles, streaming Rhizome bubbles, token accumulation, done state, cancellation, and basic error recovery.
6. **Resume and interaction basics:** Handle `interaction` SSE events enough to surface a minimal inline/review-panel summary, and wire `streamResume` only as far as needed for approve/confirm. Rich interaction management remains a 5c concern.
7. **Context basics:** Render message-context UI inside the composer, render pinned thread context under the session strip, search across objects with unified and typed search, add/remove pinned context through the active thread API, and keep true per-message context semantics deferred until the stream API accepts per-message context. Context-aware entry from other pages remains a 5c concern.
8. **Thread switcher and responsive polish:** Add the compact active-thread switcher, mobile/tablet layout states, keyboard focus behavior, overflow handling, selected-thread navigation polish, and themed read-only model selector.
9. **Embedded chat layout revision:** Convert the current framed workbench into a workspace canvas: sticky thread header, conversation-owned scrolling, anchored composer, start-thread cards that scroll away, no whole-page chat scroll, and no residual closed side-panel columns.
10. **Light drawer pass:** Convert the thread navigator and right review surface into light drawers. The right drawer should be able to host approvals now and leave clear slots for alerts and context inspection.
11. **5b test and live smoke pass:** Add focused component/page coverage for route loads, fallback `getThread`, history rendering, composer state, stream races/cancel/error, session controls, interaction review/resume, context pin/remove, anchored composer behavior, drawer open/close behavior, and start-thread task shortlist rendering, plus an opt-in live Cambium/Rhizome smoke for real streaming with the available providers.

**5b status:** Slices 1-8 are implemented and pushed on `red-maple`. After sketch review on 2026-06-23, slices 9-10 were added to align the implementation with the desired workspace model: the conversation should be embedded in the page, the thread header and composer should remain available, the start-thread helper cards should scroll away with the conversation, and thread/review/context surfaces should open as light drawers rather than permanent columns. `/app/rhizome` already has an API-backed workbench shell, recent-thread shortcuts in the blank state, open-on-demand thread navigator, selected-thread route shell, typed message history rendering, read-only themed model selector, dedicated session-context display/edit controls, blank-thread focus starter context, project-backed active focus editing, a functional composer, first-pass interaction review panel with resume streaming, local message-context UI, and fully wired pinned thread context search/add/remove. First send from the blank state creates a thread through Cambium, navigates to the returned `/app/rhizome/:threadId`, streams Rhizome's response, and exposes a top-of-conversation retry banner for stream failures. Day separators render when message timestamps are present; Rhizome's current message endpoint only returns role/content/type, so existing history currently renders without date breaks. Remaining 5c work is richer inline interaction summaries, typed review card variants, queue affordances if the backend exposes multiple pending interactions, context-aware entry from object/detail pages, backend-supported per-message context, durable non-project focus refs, inline object tagging, and agent-authored object links that open the right inspection panel.

### Today page

`TodayConditionsPanel` (weather), `RhizomeBriefingPanel` (triage + inline `InteractionCard` for pending approvals), `TodayOverviewPanel` (projects + `MiniCalendar`), `TodayTasksStrip` (top 5 with quick-complete), `ThisWeekStrip`. **Page:** `TodayPage`

Build this one deliberately thin at first — real data for everything above, but expect to come back and add widgets as Phase 6/7 land (e.g. richer project status once Projects is built). Don't over-build it now.

**Smoke test:** Today's briefing paragraph reflects real `GET /api/v1/triage/latest` data; pending interactions render inline and are actionable; clicking the mini-calendar navigates to `/app/calendar` (stub is fine until Phase 6).

### Incidents

`IncidentRow`, `IncidentDetailHeader`, `AffectedSubjectsPicker`, `TreatmentPlanSection` (dual path — AI draft + manual write), `TreatmentPlanCard`, `TreatmentStepsEditor`. **Pages:** `IncidentsPage`, `IncidentDetailPage`.

**Smoke test:** Create an incident → appears in list; "Write my own plan" → treatment plan saved and shown with steps; approve a plan → tasks generated; resolve an incident with notes → status updates.

### Activity

`ActivityPage` — `FilterRail` (category, event_type, date range, subject picker) + presentational `ObjectActivityFeed`. The page owns querying/filter state; the same feed component is reused (not rebuilt) on every other detail page across later phases with object-scoped activity data.

**Smoke test:** Global feed shows recent events across all objects; filtering by category shows only those event types; infinite scroll loads more via `before_timestamp` cursor.

---

## Phase 6 — Tasks and projects

**Deliverable:** Full task ledger (all 6 views), calendar with drag-to-reschedule and annotations, and projects covering both planning mode (brief + proposals) and execution mode (Gantt, Kanban, resources, budget, shopping).

**No real blockers left.** Tasks, Calendar, and Projects are unblocked: #113/#114 cover task series and annotations, #121/#122 cover project task graph and bulk date updates, #123/#124/#125 cover resource availability, expenses, and shopping, and #137 covers project planning plus project create/update/delete.

### Tasks

**Shared components:** `TaskRow` (type markers, source colours, hover actions), `TaskGroup` (section header + rows), `DetailPanel` (right slide-in), `VelocityStrip` (`GET /api/v1/activity/stats`)

**Pages:** `TasksPage` (all 6 views — Today, Week, Project, Kind, Area, Progress — with `FilterRail`), `TaskDetailPage`, `TaskCreatePage` (`WizardShell` 3-step + quick inline mode, "Make recurring" toggle fully live), `TaskSeriesPage` (series rule editor)

**Key interactions:** Complete → optimistic strike-through → `POST .../complete`; Defer → `InlinePopover` date picker → `POST .../defer`; Skip → `InlinePopover` reason → `POST .../skip`; Create → `POST /api/v1/tasks`

**Smoke test:** Today view shows prioritised task list; completing a task strikes through immediately and reverts if server errors; Progress view shows 14-day completion bar chart; creating a recurring task generates a `TaskSeries`.

### Calendar

**Components:** `CalendarGrid` (render-prop, month + week views), `MiniCalendar`, `DayDetailPanel`, `CalendarMarginPanel`, `WeatherIcon`, `AnnotationEditor` (fully live, not a placeholder)

**Pragmatic DnD:** drag task chip between day cells → `PATCH /api/v1/tasks/:id` → optimistic update.

**Page:** `CalendarPage`

**Smoke test:** Month view shows all tasks from `tasks/due?days_ahead=30`; dragging a task to a different day updates the date in real time; annotating a day saves and persists on reload.

### Projects

**Components:** `ProjectCard`, `PhaseIndicatorStrip`, `BriefPanel`, `ResourceAllocationPanel`, `KanbanBoard` + `KanbanCard`, `GanttChart` (task bars, date drag, *and* dependency-line drag — fully live), `ProjectProposalCard`, `PlantProgressPanel`, `BudgetTracker` (fully wired, not a placeholder), `ShoppingListPanel` (fully wired, not a placeholder)

**Pages:** `ProjectsPage`, `ProjectDetailPage`, `ProjectCreatePage` (wizard), `ProposalDetailPage`

**Smoke test:** Projects list groups by status with correct counts; planning mode can edit a brief and review/accept a proposal; execution mode shows Gantt and Kanban with real tasks and draggable dependencies; resource allocation shows available beds/containers; budget tracker reflects real expenses; shopping list purchase action creates a linked expense.

---

## Phase 7a — Garden hub & objects

**Deliverable:** Garden hub page plus full bed and container management — list, detail, create, edit, care recording, lifecycle timeline, activity history.

**No blockers.**

**Shared components (build first — also reused by 7b):** `ObjectDetailHeader`, `CareStateStrip` (log button fully live — #128 closed), `ObjectLifecycleTimeline`, `LinkedProjectChips`, `LinkedTasksList`, `ObjectActivityFeed` (same component from Phase 5's Activity page), `LedgerTable`, `FilterRail`, `TabNav`

**Pages:** `GardenPage` (map placeholder + `ProfilePanel` + `ConstraintsEditor` + tab previews — map itself stays a placeholder, blocked on #118), `BedListPage`/`BedDetailPage`/`BedCreatePage`, `ContainerListPage`/`ContainerDetailPage`/`ContainerCreatePage`

Full page-level spec: [pages/02-garden.md](../pages/02-garden.md), [pages/03-garden-objects.md](../pages/03-garden-objects.md).

**Smoke test:** Garden hub shows real profile + constraints; "Log watering" on a bed updates its care state strip immediately; create a new container → appears in list and hub preview tab; filter beds by location → filters correctly.

---

## Phase 7b — Plants

**Deliverable:** Full plant management — list (card grid + ledger), detail with propagation/lifecycle/batch info, and the 4-step creation wizard.

**No blockers.** Split out from 7a deliberately: plants carry more complexity already (lifecycle stages, batches, propagation) and will carry significantly more once visual/image understanding lands on the rhizome side (see Future roadmap below) — worth a focused pass rather than bundling with the simpler bed/container CRUD.

**Reuses 7a's shared components** (`ObjectDetailHeader`, `CareStateStrip`, `ObjectLifecycleTimeline`, `LinkedProjectChips`, `LinkedTasksList`, `ObjectActivityFeed`) plus plant-specific additions: propagation details, batch provenance, care schedule card.

**Pages:** `PlantsPage` (`FilterRail` + card grid/ledger toggle), `PlantDetailPage`, `PlantCreatePage` (`WizardShell` 4-step wizard: identity → location → timing → care/batch)

**Smoke test:** List all plants → real data, sortable columns; click a plant → detail page with care state, lifecycle dates; create a plant via the wizard, including a batch → batch and individual plant records both appear correctly.

## Phase 8 — App polish

**Deliverable:** Account/Settings page live, notification drawer and toasts wired to real data, and the production-readiness tail (code splitting, accessibility, deploy).

**No real blockers.** #130 (notification SSE) is closed — `NotificationDrawer`/`Toast` have been empty shells since Phase 3 purely because nothing existed to wire them to; that's no longer true. Settings has only one blocker: password change (cambium#20). Everything else on that page (provider/model selection, API key management, theme) is already buildable.

### Settings

Single scrollable page per [pages/08-account.md](../pages/08-account.md): profile (email read-only, password change disabled pending cambium#20), AI provider + model picker, API key management (configured/not-set status, set/update/remove), theme toggle. **Page:** `SettingsPage`

### Notifications

Wire the existing `NotificationDrawer`/`Toast` shells to `consumeNotificationStream()` (already built in Phase 4) for real job-progress and alert content: `JobProgressTree` for in-flight jobs (triage, weather refresh, series materialization, treatment plan drafting, proposal generation), alert cards for monitor alerts and new pending interactions.

**Smoke test:** Trigger a backend job (e.g. run triage from the topbar) → drawer shows live step-by-step progress; a new monitor alert → toast appears; opening Settings shows real provider/key status; changing the AI provider persists and reflects on next chat turn.

### Deploy + polish tail

**Deploy target:** Cambium serves the built static files directly on spark-thor — same-origin, no CORS, no `VITE_CAMBIUM_URL` needed in production.

**Cambium changes needed:** a static file handler serving `dist/` for all non-API routes, falling back to `index.html` for any unmatched path (required for client-side routing):

```go
// In Cambium routes.go (approximate)
fs := http.FileServer(http.Dir("./dist"))
mux.Handle("/", http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    if _, err := os.Stat("./dist" + r.URL.Path); os.IsNotExist(err) {
        http.ServeFile(w, r, "./dist/index.html")
        return
    }
    fs.ServeHTTP(w, r)
}))
```

**Build process:**
```bash
npm run build                  # produces dist/
cp -r dist/ ../cambium/dist/    # or configure STATIC_DIR env var
```

**Alternative:** a separate `Dockerfile` for verdant-pages that builds with Node and copies `dist/` as a build artifact into the Cambium image — cleaner for CI.

Raise a Cambium issue for the static file handler when ready to deploy.

**Other polish tasks:**
- Code splitting — lazy load all page components via `React.lazy` + `Suspense`
- Accessibility audit — keyboard navigation, focus management in Modal/Drawer, ARIA labels on nav
- Performance baseline — Lighthouse on Today, Tasks, Calendar pages
- Self-hosted fonts — see [design-tokens.md](../architecture/design-tokens.md)
- Visual QA — compare all pages against the mockups in [design/mockups/](../design/mockups/)

## Future roadmap (not phase-assigned)

Items with a real backend blocker still open, or deliberately out of scope for Phases 5–8. Pick these up as their blocker closes — none of them gate any phase above.

| Item | Depends on | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Media galleries | rhizome#117 | `MediaGallery` upload + lightbox on plants/beds/containers/incidents. Not started server-side at all. |
| Garden spatial map | rhizome#118 | `GardenMap` minimap + `ExpandedMapOverlay` on the Garden hub. Not started server-side at all. |
| Visual garden understanding | rhizome roadmap initiative | Image-based plant/disease/pest identification. The reason Plants got split into its own phase (7b) — this will extend that page significantly once it lands. |

            Tasks · Calendar · Projects
          ↓
Phase 7a  Garden hub & objects ← no blockers   } sequential — 7b reuses 7a's shared components
Phase 7b  Plants               ← no blockers   }

          Future roadmap (media, garden map, visual understanding — pick up as blockers close)
```

**Estimated phase sizes:**

| Phase | Size |
|---|---|
| 5 | 4–5 days (largest single phase — agent chat is the most complex page in the app) |
| 6 | 4–5 days |
| 7a | 2–3 days |
| 7b | 2 days |
| 8 | 2–3 days |
