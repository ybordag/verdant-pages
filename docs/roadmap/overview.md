# Roadmap

## How we work

Work is organised into **phases** — each phase has a clear deliverable and a smoke test. Phases 1–4 are sequential. Phases 5a–5e are independent and can run in parallel. Phase 6 is blocked on a Rhizome backend dependency.

Active phase work gets a doc in `docs/current_work/`. Completed phase docs stay there as a record.

## Phase 0 — Pre-build setup ✅

- CLAUDE.md written to repo root
- Confirmed Cambium runs on `:8080`
- Confirmed Rhizome runs on `:8001`
- Confirmed test user exists

---

## Phase 1 — Scaffold + build tooling ✅

**Deliverable:** Project boots, proxies to Cambium, TypeScript compiles clean.

Done:
- Vite 8, React 19, TypeScript strict mode
- Vite proxy: `/api` + `/auth` → `localhost:8080`
- `@/` path alias
- `react-router-dom`, `@tanstack/react-query`, `@tanstack/react-table` installed
- Prettier, ESLint
- `.env.example`, `.nvmrc` (Node 24)
- Empty `src/styles/`, `src/lib/`, `src/components/`, `src/pages/`, `src/routes/`
- `App.tsx` renders `<div>Verdant Pages</div>`
- **Vitest + @testing-library/react** — unit/component test scaffold
- **Playwright** — E2E scaffold with Chromium
- Smoke tests passing: App renders, `npm run build` clean

---

## Phase 2 — Tokens + theme + fonts ✅

**Deliverable:** Full visual foundation — light/dark toggle works, all fonts load. See [phase2_tokens.md](../current_work/phase2_tokens.md) for the full record.

- `src/styles/tokens.css` — full token system ported from `docs/design/mockup.html` (not the simplified prototype): inkwell/vellum scale, RGB channel variables, border radius scale, display variation tokens, semantic surface/text/line tokens for both themes
- `src/styles/global.css` — reset, body, scrollbar, shared keyframes
- `src/styles/utilities.css` — layout and chip utilities
- Google Fonts `<link>` in `index.html` — Shantell Sans, Caveat, Nunito, Montserrat
- `ThemeProvider` — reads/writes `localStorage('theme')`, sets `data-theme` on `<html>`, defaults to dark
- App.tsx wrapped in `ThemeProvider`

**Tests:** 9 unit (ThemeProvider) + 3 E2E (default dark, toggle to light, persistence on reload) — folded into the broader suite in Phase 3.

---

## Phase 3 — Primitives + app shell ✅

**Deliverable:** Full app shell with navigation, all routes stubbed, all 7 nav items. See [phase3_app_shell.md](../current_work/phase3_app_shell.md) for the full record.

**Primitives:** `Button`, `Input`, `Select`, `Textarea`, `Chip`, `FieldLabel`, `Modal`, `InlinePopover`, `StatusBadge`, `ProgressBar`

**Shell:** `AppShell`, `AppNav` (renamed from `VPNav` for genericness — see naming audit below), `NavContext`, `QuickActionsPanel`, `GardenProfileCard`, `NavFooter`, `NotificationDrawer` (empty shell), `Toast` (empty shell), `Breadcrumb`

**Router:** all routes from [routes.md](../architecture/routes.md), 27 page stubs, `ProtectedRoute` (passthrough until Phase 4)

**Tests:** 30 total (20 unit + 10 E2E) covering all 7 nav items, collapse/expand + persistence, pending-badge "lit icon" state, route navigation, notification drawer, theme toggle, Toast and Breadcrumb component behavior.

---

## Phase 4 — Auth + API client foundation 🚧 in progress (`birch`)

**Deliverable:** Login and register work against the real Cambium API. Protected routes redirect correctly. Proactive token refresh runs. All API modules are written and typed.

**Done so far:**
- `LandingPage` — public marketing page at `/` (wordmark, tagline, GitHub link, theme toggle, Login/Sign Up)
- `AuthLayout`, `LoginPage`, `RegisterPage` — real forms with client-side validation (required fields, email format, password length/match), botanical-aesthetic card layout. `onSubmit` handlers validate and stop — no `apiFetch` to call yet.
- `ThemeToggle` extracted into a shared primitive (`src/components/primitives/ThemeToggle/`), used by `AppNav`, `LandingPage`, and `AuthLayout`
- All 10 UI primitives now have unit tests (the last 7 — `Select`, `Textarea`, `Chip`, `Modal`, `InlinePopover`, `StatusBadge`, `ProgressBar` — landed alongside this work; see [deferred-work.md](../development/deferred-work.md))
- `Button` gained a `ghost-clay` variant — see the variant table in [components.md](../architecture/components.md)
- Tests: 12 unit (`LoginPage.test.tsx`, `RegisterPage.test.tsx`) + 4 E2E (`landing.spec.ts`)

**Not started — the actual "auth + API client" part:**
- `src/lib/api/client.ts` — `apiFetch`, `ApiError`, 401→refresh→retry
- `src/lib/api/auth.ts` — `login`, `register`, `logout`, `tryRefreshToken`, `getSession`
- `src/lib/auth/context.tsx` — `AuthProvider`, `useAuth`, proactive refresh timer
- `ProtectedRoute` — still a passthrough, no real auth check
- All 16 domain API modules (`garden.ts`, `plants.ts`, `tasks.ts`, …) + `src/lib/types/{rhizome,cambium}.ts`
- `src/lib/api/stream.ts` — `consumeSSEStream`, `consumeNotificationStream`
- `QueryClientProvider` wired into `App.tsx` — not present yet
- Vite proxy (configured since Phase 1) confirmed working end-to-end — unverified, nothing has called it yet

**Tests still needed:**
- `apiFetch` attaches `Authorization` header
- 401 response triggers refresh → retry → redirect
- `ProtectedRoute` redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`
- E2E: register → login → protected page → logout → login required

---

## Phases 5a–5e — Feature pages (parallel)

All require Phase 4 complete. No ordering between 5a–5e.

**5a Garden objects** — beds, containers, plants (list, detail, create, care)  
**5b Tasks** — 6 views, optimistic mutations, velocity strip ← highest priority  
**5c Projects** — planning mode, Gantt, Kanban (partial blockers: expenses #124, shopping #125, Gantt dependencies #121/#122)  
**5d Calendar** — drag-to-reschedule, month/week views (partial blocker: annotations #114)  
**5e Activity** — global feed with filtering and infinite scroll

---

## Phase 6 — Today, Incidents, Agent chat

**Blocked on:** rhizome#120 P1 — `TriageSnapshotView`, `WeatherSnapshotView`, `InteractionEnvelopeView`, `IncidentView`, `ThreadView` must land first.

**6a** Today page  
**6b** Incidents + treatment plans  
**6c** Agent chat with SSE streaming ← the user's milestone

---

## Phase 7 — Feature backfill

Each item is independent. Build in any order as backend issues close.

| Feature | Blocks on |
|---|---|
| Context search + pinned context | rhizome#126 + #127 |
| Care recording quick actions | rhizome#128 |
| Full Gantt dependency drag | rhizome#121 + #122 |
| Project expenses | rhizome#124 |
| Shopping list | rhizome#125 |
| Media gallery | rhizome#117 |
| Garden map | rhizome#118 |
| Calendar annotations | rhizome#114 |
| Notification drawer + toasts | rhizome#130 |
| Task series CRUD | rhizome#113 |

---

## Phase 8 — Polish + deploy

- Code splitting (`React.lazy` + `Suspense`)
- Accessibility audit
- Lighthouse baseline
- Self-hosted fonts
- Cambium static file handler (cambium#21)
- Deploy to spark-thor

---
