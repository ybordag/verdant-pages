# Component Library

## Styling approach

- **CSS modules** for component-specific styles — each component has a `.module.css`, locally scoped
- **`tokens.css`** — single source of truth for all design tokens (see [design-tokens.md](design-tokens.md))
- **`utilities.css`** — shared classes from the prototype: `.dg` (dot grid), `.gg` (line grid), `.chip`, `.hr`, `.cd`, `.nb`
- No CSS-in-JS, no Tailwind — always `var(--token-name)`, never hardcoded colours
- **No drawers** anywhere except the notification drawer (the single exception — see §2)

## Key libraries

| Library | Used for |
|---|---|
| **TanStack Table v8** | All ledger tables (tasks, beds, containers, plants, expenses, shopping list) |
| **Pragmatic Drag and Drop** | Calendar rescheduling, Gantt bars and dependencies |
| **TanStack Query v5** | All server state — no component fetches directly |

## Component tiers

| Tier | Domain knowledge | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Primitives** | None | Button, Input, Chip |
| **Composed** | Domain types | TaskRow, CareStateStrip |
| **Pages** | Full page + data fetching | TodayPage, TasksPage |
| **Layout** | Routing, not domain data | VPNav, AppShell |

---

## 1. Primitives

No domain knowledge. Could be dropped into any app.

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| `Button` | `variant`: `primary` (chartreuse), `ghost` (border only), `danger`. Size: `sm` / `md`. |
| `Input` | Styled `<input>` with chartreuse focus ring. |
| `Select` | Styled `<select>`. |
| `Textarea` | Auto-resize with chartreuse caret. |
| `Chip` | Pill tag. `color` maps to tokens. `removable` shows `×`. |
| `FieldLabel` | Uppercase Montserrat, 9–10px, letter-spaced. Equivalent to `LBL`/`SMLL` in prototype. |
| `Modal` | Focus-trapped overlay. Closes on Escape + backdrop click. |
| `InlinePopover` | Small contextual popup anchored to a trigger element. Used for: care log (datetime + note), task defer (date picker), task skip (reason input). |
| `StatusBadge` | Small coloured pill for status/urgency/severity values. |
| `ProgressBar` | Horizontal fill bar for task completion %, budget burn. |

---

## 2. App Shell & Navigation

### `AppShell`

Root layout. Composes `VPNav` + content wrapper + `NotificationDrawer` portal.

```
AppShell
  ├── VPNav (left, fixed)
  ├── .cw content wrapper (flex column, fills remaining width)
  └── NotificationDrawer portal (right edge, conditionally open)
```

---

### `VPNav`

Fixed left sidebar. 210px expanded, 52px collapsed.

```
VPNav
  ├── Brand row (logo + collapse toggle)
  ├── NavSection × 3
  │     └── NavItem × N (icon + label + badge count)
  ├── QuickActionsPanel (sidebar widget)
  ├── GardenProfileCard (sidebar widget)
  └── NavFooter
        ├── UserAvatar + email → /app/settings
        ├── ThemeToggle (persists to localStorage)
        └── NotificationBell → opens NotificationDrawer
```

**NavItem states:**

| State | Visual |
|---|---|
| Default | Icon + label at `--text-s` (70% opacity) |
| Has pending items, collapsed | Icon at `--text-p` (94% — lit, no badge) |
| Has pending items, expanded | Chartreuse badge count pill beside label |
| Active | Chartreuse left border + `--nav-accent` text + `--nav-active-bg` tint |

**NavSection groups:**

| Group | Items | Badge source |
|---|---|---|
| Orientation | Rhizome, Today | Rhizome: pending interaction count |
| Work | Tasks, Calendar, Projects | Tasks: open count; Projects: active count |
| Operational | Incidents, Activity | Incidents: open count |

---

### `QuickActionsPanel` (sidebar widget)

Three action buttons inside a card widget. Sits below the nav items.

| Button | Collapsed icon | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Ask Rhizome | Speech bubble | Navigate to `/app/rhizome` |
| + New Task | Plus | Navigate to `/app/tasks/new` |
| ▶ Run Triage | Play triangle | `POST /api/v1/triage/run` |

Collapsed: three stacked icon buttons (labels hidden).

---

### `GardenProfileCard` (sidebar widget)

Always-visible portal to all garden objects. Sits below QuickActionsPanel.

**Expanded:** zone badge, object count, mini plot grid, chip links → Garden, Plants, Beds, Containers.

**Collapsed:** single garden icon button → `/app/garden`.

---

### `NotificationDrawer`

The **one and only drawer** in the app. Slides in from the right when the NotificationBell is clicked.

```
NotificationDrawer
  └── NotificationPanel
        ├── In Progress section
        │     └── JobProgressTree × N
        ├── Pending Approval section
        │     └── InteractionCard × N (compact)
        └── Alerts section
              └── AlertRow × N
```

---

### `JobProgressTree`

Renders one background job's subtask tree. Steps arrive via SSE `job_step` events and update live.

```
JobProgressTree
  ├── Job title + status indicator
  └── StepRow × N  (step label + ✅/🔄 icon)
```

---

### `Toast`

Ephemeral bottom-right notification. Auto-dismisses after 4s. Triggered by `job_complete` and high-severity `alert` SSE events. Clicking navigates to the relevant page.

---

### `Breadcrumb`

`.bc` bar — `--font-label`, 9px, uppercase, letter-spaced. Shows current location path.

---

## 3. Shared data display

### `LedgerTable`

Wrapper around TanStack Table v8. Used for: task ledger, beds list, containers list, plants ledger view, expenses, shopping list.

```typescript
interface LedgerTableProps<T> {
  columns: ColumnDef<T>[];
  data: T[];
  onRowClick?: (row: T) => void;
  enableSorting?: boolean;
  enableFiltering?: boolean;
}
```

Applies token styling: chartreuse-tinted sticky header, `--line-on-paper` row borders, `.hr` hover state.

---

### `FilterRail`

Left filter panel pattern. Used on: Tasks (all views), Plants, Beds, Containers, Incidents, Activity. ~200px wide, takes a `filters` config array and calls `onChange` on each update.

```typescript
interface FilterRailProps {
  filters: FilterConfig[];   // { label, type: "select"|"chips"|"daterange"|"toggle", options?, value, onChange }
  onReset: () => void;
}
```

---

### `TabNav`

Within-page tab navigation. Used on: Garden hub (Overview/Beds/Containers/Plants/Activity), Project detail (Gantt/Kanban/List/Resources). Renders tab buttons with active underline in `--nav-accent`.

---

### `ObjectActivityFeed`

Cursor-paginated activity feed. Used on the `/app/activity` full page AND embedded on every object detail page.

```typescript
interface ObjectActivityFeedProps {
  endpoint: string;          // '/api/v1/activity' or '/api/v1/garden/plants/:id/activity'
  showFilters?: boolean;     // true on full page, false on detail sections
  limit?: number;
}
```

---

## 4. Garden map

### `GardenMap`

Renders the spatial garden plan from `GET /api/v1/garden/layout`. Two modes:

**Minimap** (default in garden hub hero): compact, fixed height, clickable to expand.

**ExpandedMapOverlay** (full screen): pan/zoom via pointer events, clickable object labels navigate to the relevant detail page, hovering an object shows name + status + image thumbnails. Close button returns to hub.

**Empty state** (no layout yet): placeholder with prompt — "Send Rhizome a sketch or photos to generate your garden plan."

Bed/area fills are colour-coded by status: active (pine tint), empty (neutral), weather-flagged (cornflower tint), selected (chartreuse outline).

---

## 5. Shared garden object components

Used across plant/bed/container detail pages.

### `ObjectDetailHeader`

Shared header for Plant, Bed, and Container detail pages.

```typescript
interface ObjectDetailHeaderProps {
  name: string;
  typeBadge: "Plant" | "Bed" | "Container";
  locationBreadcrumb?: string;
  statusBadge?: string;
  onEdit: () => void;
  onDelete: () => void;
  deleteLabel?: string;           // "Remove" for plants (soft delete), "Delete" for beds/containers
}
```

---

### `CareStateStrip`

Six care tiles: watered, fertilized, amended, inspected, treated, pruned. Colour-coded by recency (green/amber/red). Each tile has a "Log" button opening an `InlinePopover` — datetime picker + optional note — that fires `POST /api/v1/garden/{type}/{id}/care`.

---

### `ObjectLifecycleTimeline`

Horizontal milestone timeline. Shared across plant detail (explicit date fields) and bed/container detail (activity-derived milestones from care events).

```typescript
interface Milestone { label: string; date: Date | null; completed: boolean; }
interface ObjectLifecycleTimelineProps { milestones: Milestone[]; }
```

---

### `LinkedProjectChips`

Chips for associated projects. Clicking navigates to `/app/projects/:id`.

---

### `LinkedTasksList`

Compact list of open tasks where this object is a `linked_subject`. Quick-complete checkbox calls `POST /api/v1/tasks/{id}/complete` with optimistic update.

---

### `MediaGallery`

Image grid with thumbnails + lightbox. `+` button opens file picker for upload.

```
MediaGallery
  ├── MediaThumbnail × N
  └── LightboxOverlay (full-size + caption, prev/next navigation)
```

---

### `CurrentPlantsList`

For bed and container detail pages: compact list of plants currently growing there. Each row: plant name, status badge, sow date. Links to `/app/plants/:id`.

---

### `ConstraintsEditor`

Garden hub constraints section. Renders hard constraints and soft preferences as editable chips. Inline text editing on click; `+` adds a new entry. Saves via `PATCH /api/v1/garden/profile`.

---

## 6. Calendar components

### `CalendarGrid`

Core calendar renderer. Grid structure only — **no DnD dependency itself**. Uses a render prop so DnD can be layered on by the caller.

```typescript
interface CalendarGridProps {
  year: number;
  month: number;
  view: "month" | "week";
  renderDay: (date: Date, events: CalendarEvent[]) => ReactNode;
}
```

The full Calendar page wraps task chips in Pragmatic DnD `Draggable` and day cells in `Droppable`. MiniCalendar passes a simple renderer that shows event dots only.

---

### `MiniCalendar`

Wraps `CalendarGrid` with compact sizing. Used in: Today page right column, Calendar margin panel.

---

### `DayDetailPanel`

Slides in alongside the calendar when a day cell is clicked (not a navigation). Shows: full task list for the day (with complete checkboxes), annotation with inline edit, weather detail, "List view →" link to Tasks page.

---

### `CalendarMarginPanel`

Right sidebar on the full Calendar page. Paper-planner aesthetic.

```
CalendarMarginPanel
  ├── Month number (Shantell Sans, large)
  ├── Month name (Caveat)
  ├── AnnotationEditor (selected day note, inline edit)
  ├── MonthChecklist (persistent cross-month notes)
  └── MiniCalendar × 2 (previous and next months)
```

---

### `WeatherIcon`

---

## 7. Task components

### `TaskRow`

The core task ledger row. Used in: Tasks page (all views), Today page (top 5 strip), DayDetailPanel.

- **Type marker:** circle (maintenance), diamond (opportunistic), square (milestone/emergency)
- **Source colour:** green left border (Rhizome), clay (user), cornflower (weather)
- **Hover reveals:** defer (`InlinePopover` date picker), skip (`InlinePopover` reason input), edit button
- **Clicking the row body:** opens `DetailPanel` with full task detail

---

### `TaskGroup`

Section header + grouped `TaskRow` list. Header: section name, urgency colour dot, open task count.

---

### `DetailPanel`

Dark-background right slide-in. Used for task detail in Tasks page and day detail in Calendar. **Width:** 270–340px.

```
DetailPanel
  ├── Title + kicker label (chartreuse top border accent)
  ├── Content slot (varies by caller)
  └── "Open full page →" link
```

---

### `VelocityStrip`

Four summary cards at the top of the Tasks ledger (Today view only). Populated from `GET /api/v1/activity/stats`.
